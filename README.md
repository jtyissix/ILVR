> **Abstract:** Interleaved reasoning paradigms enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual feedback but are hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of re-encoding pixel-dense images. A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet faces limitations: methods either fail to capture intermediate state evolution due to single-step, non-interleaved structures, or sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. Specifically, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a momentum teacher model selectively distills relevant features from ground-truth intermediate images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Environment Setup
The code is tested with **Python 3.11**. We recommend using Conda for environment management.

```bash
# 1. Create a conda environment
conda create -n ilvr python=3.11
conda activate ilvr

# 2. Install standard dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Install custom Transformers library
# ILVR requires modifications to the standard transformers library.
# We provide the modified source code in this repository.
cd transformers
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

### 2. Accelerate Configuration
This project uses HuggingFace `accelerate` for distributed training. Please configure it before running the training script.

```bash
accelerate config
```

## 📚 Data Preparation

We utilize the CoMT dataset (Chain of Multi-modal Thought) as an example for constructing training data. For more details about the benchmark, please refer to the [CoMT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12932).

### Download Data
We provide the processed data on HuggingFace. Please download it from [shuai22/comt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shuai22/comt) and organize the directory as follows.

1. Download `TRAIN.jsonl`, `TEST.jsonl`, and `comt.tar.gz`.
2. Extract the images from the tarball.

**Expected Directory Structure:**
```text
ILVR/
├── data/
│   ├── TRAIN.jsonl
│   ├── TEST.jsonl
│   └── images_comt/      <-- Extracted from comt.tar.gz
│       ├── creation/
│       └── ...
├── src/
├── transformers/
├── run_training.sh
└── README.md
```

### Data Format
The dataset follows the JSONL format:
- **text_input**: The question/instruction.
- **image_input**: Initial input images.
- **sequence_plan**: The interleaved chain-of-thought rationale containing "text" and "helper_image" paths.

## 🚀 Training

We provide a shell script `run_training.sh` to launch distributed training.

### 1. Configure Script
Open `run_training.sh` and modify the paths to match your local setup:

```bash
# In run_training.sh:

# Path to the directory containing TRAIN.jsonl
DATA_PATH="/path/to/your/data" 

# Directory to save model checkpoints
SAVE_MODEL_PATH="/path/to/save/checkpoints"

# File path for training logs
LOG_FILE="/path/to/save/train.log"

# (Optional) HuggingFace Cache Directory
export HF_HOME="/path/to/cache" 
```

### 2. Run Training
Start training with the following command:

```bash
bash run_training.sh
```

**Default Hyperparameters:**
- Base Model: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct`
- Epochs: 15
- Gradient Accumulation Steps: 8
- Latent Size: 8
